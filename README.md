Project Title:
ðŸ“Š E-Commerce Analytics using Python & SQL

Overview:
This project demonstrates how to transform raw e-commerce data into actionable business insights. I used Python and SQL to import, clean, and analyze a dataset from Kaggle. Visualizations were created using Matplotlib and Seaborn in Jupyter Notebook to highlight key trends and patterns.

Tech Stack:

Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

SQL - MySQL 

Jupyter Notebook

Kaggle Dataset

Key Features:

ðŸ”¹ Data Import & Processing

Cleaned and normalized e-commerce data using Python

Dumped all CSVs into a SQL database for efficient querying

ðŸ”¹ SQL Analysis

âœ… 15+ questions solved using SQL (Basic to Advanced)

Examples: Total sales by category, order trends, customer retention, revenue contribution by seller
